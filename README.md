## **How to run**

**Product List**: The product list will show the products being sold. It will have an icon that uses images from Lorem Picsum, along with the product name, cost and in stock quantity. There is also an "add to cart" button which allows you to add the product to the cart.

**Cart**: The cart starts off empty and will update each time you add an item from the product list. You can remove the items by opening up the item card and selecting the remove from cart text.

**Checkout**: The checkout will list a summary of the product names in the cart and total cost.

## **Road Map**

1. Add a validation to check if in stock quantities is greater than 0. 0 quantities should not allow item to be added to cart.
2. Concatenate the values of the quantities of same items into one line instead of separately.
